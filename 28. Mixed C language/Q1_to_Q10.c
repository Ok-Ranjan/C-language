/*1.Define a funtion to produce all the combinations of strings that can be made out of
charcters of given string, selecting r at a time, Return a dynamically created
array of strings holding all combinations.*/

/*2.Write a function to print all distinct pattern of 0s and 1s of given length.*/

/*3.Write a program to print system data.*/

/*4.Write a program to print system time.*/

/*5.Given an array of size n, reverse it. Input format - The first line contains an integer n
denoting the size of the array. the next line contains n space separated integers denothing
the elements of the array. The output should print the array in the desired order, elements
separated by spaces.*/

/*6.There is a series S, where the next term is the sum of previous three terms. Given
the first three terms of the series, a, b and c. You have to output the nth term of the
series using recursion. Input format - The first line contains a single integer n. The
next line contains three space separated integers a, b and c. The output format -
print the nth term of the series.*/

/*7.Define a struture triangle which can contain lenghts of the sides of traingle. Sort
a list of triangles according to their areas. Input format - first line contains a number
n which is number of triangles. Subsequent n lines, each contains three space separated
numbers (sides of the triangle). Output format - display the tuples (side1, side2, side3)
of triangle in sorted order (according to area of triangle).*/
